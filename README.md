# Project description
This is a group project developed for the course of Software Engineering for Geoinformatics 2024/2025

For this project we developed an application to support air quality analysis using “Dati Lombardia” sensor data. The application is mainly composed of a database, a server and a dashboard

This repository contains: 
- DASHBOARD.ipynb
- SERVER.ipynb
- DATA folder : data used to set up the database
- Database_setup.ipynb: Script containing the workflow we used to set up the database and   some preprocessing on the data
- RASD: Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
- DD: Design Document
- assets folder: containing the Polimi logo and some css for the dashboard
- SoftwareReleaseDocument
- Old code: folder containing all the old code we used to develop the project
